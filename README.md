# House-app
This is a project that I made to test Firebase and Realtime DB to manage users and create messaging channels. This app lets users create, join and chat in Private Houses. A 'House' is a sub-Array that is generated on my Realtime DB. Users can send and read any text that is pushed in the sub-array. Only users with access to the House Name and Password can enter the House.
Firebase and Realtime DB are used for sign up/in and storing chat logs respectively.
